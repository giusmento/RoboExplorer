#EVENT-BASED FRAMEWORK

This Python framework implements an event-based architecture used to simplify management and communication
between small appliances such as robot and IOT boards. 
It includes libraries to collect data from sensors and a messaging system to easily establish communication
and data sharing between internal components and multiple boards and external services

## The architecture

The architecture implements three layers: 

**1.Wrapping hardware layer:** it is a purely hardware control.

**2.Board awareness layer:** defines an abstract definition of all isolated hardware components 

**3.Control and monitoring layer:** defines the event-based logic and control communication with external sources
