# EVENT-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK

A simple event-driven architecture to control small appliances such as robot and IOT boards. 

It includes libraries for various sensors and a 
communication protocols that enables connections with other devices. 

A simple web-based application collects and monitor your IOT board

## The Architecture - The main components

The framework is build around three layers. Each layer implements a setof API used to masquerate the layer below and to release a more comprehensive and intuitive interfaces. 
The three layers are:

 1. **High-level- Thread Services:**  defines service threads used to gather data and recursive operations 
 2. **Medium-level- RoboControl Implementation:** implements controls and artificial intelligence layer
 3. **Low-level- Hardware abstract:** masquerates hradware component libraries in a set of APIs

The external communication is implemented using a **WebSocket Server**. 
The socket connection provides a simple channel where the board sends data and receives instructions.

A build-in **Web-Application** simplifies connection and monitoring.


### The class diagram

The following class diagram shows how the framework implements the underlined architecture. 
This picture identifies connections and relations between classes at every architecture level.

In a simple description the low-level components (ex. RoboMotors, RoboServos, distance and temperature sensors) 
are wrapped in the RoboExplorer component. RoboExplorer is actually the abstract view of your board/robot and defines all APIs used to control it.

RoboExplorer is controlled by the RoboControl. This class is an implementation of the abstract class ABC_RoboControl.
The RoboControl defines the logic of your board/robot and is fully customizable. 
At this stage the component complexity is defined by the end-user,
your RoboControl implementation can contain mathematical models, artificial intelligence or a simple on-off button.

RoboControl extends the registrable class enabling the component to support event-driven calls.

### The event-driven solution

A real-time solution requires that actions are taken on the bases of received events. 
This approach allows an application to promptly response to every external change. 
Think about a the distance sensor that detects an obstacle and the board needs to immediately stop motors or 
a temperature sensor that detects high temperature that requires fan to be activated.
 
All these cases requires a framework with built-in event controls APIs.

This framework implements event controls by leveraging the observer pattern. 

The following schema defines how an event triggers an action on the RoboControl component

1. RoboControl extends the Registrable class. It inherits two methods: register_observer and register_receiver
2. The "Board monitor sensor thread" initialises an Observer object. 
This object uses the register_observer and register_receiver method to register a RoboControl method.
3. The registered method is called every time the Observer object emits a message.

This simple pattern allows events to be promptly passed from the high-layer to the medium-layer. 
The RoboControl logic defines interactions with the low-layer.

## How I can start using the framework

Integrate the framework in your development is really simple. You have mainly to implement two classes:

1. RoboExplorer: this is strictly connected to your board/robot. here you have to wrap all your sensors and actuators.
2. RoboControl: this is the funniest part. Define how your board/robot interacts with the external world by implementing your own RoboControl

Additionally you can start new threads that gather data from all your sensors

This repository contains an example of a raspberry PI board with 2 motors, 2 servos and a distance sensor.

## The web-based application
The built-in web application allow you to monitor and control your board. 
The web application starts with the framework at the port 3000.
